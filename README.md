# Living Wall Retaining Wall
 
 
With so many plant varieties, color options, and visual patterns, designing a green living wall may seem like an arduous task. In this video, Dr. Anna Droz shows that this process is actually very simple, intuitive, and a wonderful way to utilize both your imagination and your green thumb! She walks us through each step of the design: from concept, to plant selection and even installation and final results.

LiveWall outdoor systems are designed to withstand the elements. Architectural quality planters are molded from the same material as car bumpers. Our unique RainRails deliver water through anodized aluminum rails, which maintain their beautiful finish and integrity in all weather conditions.
 
Green walls serve as therapeutic elements in your environment. Patients exposed to nature have demonstrated faster healing times, reduced need for medications, and increased levels of satisfaction with their care.
 
Living walls in the office environment help to connect employees with nature. This contributes to enhanced employee performance, stronger focus, increased creativity, improved attendance and retention.

We wondered what are some good retaining wall ideas? Prostrate rosemary! Dick & I love the blueish-purple flowers and the glossy deep-green leaves. It softens the hard grey concrete wall into a lovely living wall with delightful visual interest to enjoy year-round, especially from the hot tub with a tasty adult beverage. Oh, the joys!

**The VERSA-Green Plantable Wall System combines the durability and strength of a VERSA-LOK segmental retaining wall with the lush beauty of a hanging garden. Inside each unit is a 6"-deep plantable core for planting and a groove in the top to accommodate irrigation tubing. The result is a functional wall that becomes a living part of your landscape.**
 
\*This is the maximum stable unreinforced height for 12-inch deep VERSA-LOK units in optimum conditions. Poor soils, additional loading, or slopes on top of a wall or bottom of a wall will reduce the maximum stable unreinforced height.
 
Kodah retaining wall blocks are sold by the pallet and each pallet includes landscaping blocks in four different lengths to give your walls a varied, natural look with fewer repeating patterns. The landscape block comes in several colors to match your decor and all retaining wall stones are designed to preserve their beauty in even the most challenging conditions. Use Kodah retaining wall block systems to build multi-level garden walls, enclosed outdoor entertaining areas or dignified retaining walls to protect your outdoor living areas from erosion. For more retaining wall ideas, check out the Nicolock Paving Stones design gallery.
 
Fry added a couple more plant varieties to the mix as well, including bugleweed and brunnera. The new varieties could provide more potential for flowers on the wall, which can serve as a food source for pollinators like native bees and butterflies.
 
The green wall technology is gradually improving because there are two types of irrigation systems that help the plants grow. The first is recirculating the irrigation system. For this, there has to be an irrigation tank beneath the wall. Tanks have to be full to provide an adequate supply of water to the plants. When gravity pulls water downward, water is directed to the irrigation tank to be used again.
 
When choosing plants, make sure to consider the shape, texture, and color. There is a wide range of plants that you can choose from for your green wall, including small shrubs, grass, herbs, and herbaceous perennials. To help you pick plants suitable for your green wall, consider consulting with a garden nursery.
 
To maintain a healthy green wall, ensure that the plants you select are suitable for the surrounding climate. Maintenance is also essential to ensure that the plants do not dry. Shop our products below to get started building your green outdoor living wall.
 
Wooly pockets, an awesome product, were a bit too far out of my price range at a whopping 40 bucks a pop.. to get the look I was going for would cost an arm and a leg. So, when I came across this abandoned bed frame on the corner of my street my creative cogs started to spin! I improvised this makeshift fern wall and have maintained it for the past few years. Today, I wanted to share with you guys how I put it together.
 
After completing this in all square holes of my bed frame I took a strong wire with a pliable gauge and reinforced all of the pockets. **This part is crucial.** These pockets will need to hold **a lot** of weight once you fill them with moss, soil and watered plants; so to be sure not to skimp on the enforcing here. More is good, too much is the right amount here.
 
The term green walls encompasses all forms of vegetated wall surfaces. However, there are three major system categories that fall under this term: green facades, living walls, and retaining living walls.
 
Green facades are systems in which vines and climbing plants or cascading ground covers grow into supporting structures that are purposely designed for their location. Plants growing on green facades are generally rooted in soil beds at the base of the structure, in elevated planters at intermediate levels, or on rooftops. Depending on climate, choice of species, depth of soil bed, orientation, nutrition, and irrigation regime, green facades may take several seasons before achieving maturity. Green facades can be attached to existing walls or built as freestanding structures. They are used to shade glazed facades, walkways, and are built as arbors, trellis structures, baffles, or fences.
 
Living wall systems are composed of pre-vegetated panels, modules, planted blankets or bags that are affixed to a structural wall or free-standing frame. These modules can be made of plastic, expanded polystyrene, synthetic fabric, clay, and concrete and support a greater diversity and density of plant species (e.g. a lush mixture of ground covers, ferns, low shrubs, perennial flowers, and edible plants) than green facades. To date, many living wall installations can be found in both tropical and temperate locations. Living walls can perform well in full sun, shade, and interior building applications.
 
Retaining living walls are engineered living structures that are designed to stabilize a slope, while supporting vegetation contained in their structure. They provide the structural strength to resist the lateral forces exerted by angles greater than the natural angle of repose of soil and protects slopes against erosion.
 
They are often modular for ease of installation, and made of geo-textile bags in conjunction with interlocking units, metal, concrete, plastic cellular confinement mats or woven willow plants. Some systems can perform on slopes up to 88 degrees and many have the capacity for variable slope angles as flat as 45 degrees. While performing the same structural function as their more widely known non-living, solid-faced predecessors, all living retaining wall systems and methods must allow for a suitable volume of soil at the face of the system. The growing media must be sheltered from erosion, be accessible to the introduction of plant material either from plugs or seed and provide for long-term plant growth. The mature living retaining wall is intended to be fully covered by its internally supported vegetation such that the underlying structural elements are no longer visible as the wall becomes additional green space and habitat for the project.
 
Please note: while there are similarities among green walls, each installation is unique. Hence, all technical performance details provided will vary by region, climate, building, design, and green wall type.

Most North Americans spend 80-90% of their time indoors (Jenkins et al. 1992) and as a result, are highly influenced by the effectiveness of interior air circulation systems. It has been estimated that problems associated with poor indoor air quality negatively affect workplace production by $60 billion per year in the United States (Reitze 1998).

Also impressed with both delivery and packaging of the product beautifully wrapped in tissue and boxed. We looked at the competition and came to conclusion that Vistafolia was best by far!
 
I am so thrilled that I picked Vistafolia. Our roof terrace looks amazing with the combination of the foliage panels and cedar panelling. The whole process could not have been simpler and the team worked hard and paid such attention to detail during the installation. I would thoroughly recommend them.
